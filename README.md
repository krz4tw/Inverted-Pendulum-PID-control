# Inverted-Pendulum-PID-control
The goal is to create an PID controller for an inverted pendulum built out of a salvaged Inkjet printer.

ItÂ´s using linear and rotational quadrature encoders found in the printer to determine the linear position of the cart and
the angle of the pendulum. Its also using a salavaged photointerrupter as a limit switch.
The motor is driven by an L298N Motordriver by an external power supply.

A video of the system in action along with further explenations and questions can be found here:
